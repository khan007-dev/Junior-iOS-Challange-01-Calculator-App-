Calculator Application 
Implement a basic calculator app with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
Description: 
We have a project requirement to recreate the iOS calculator app using SwiftUI. This project encompasses several key challanges, including math operations, grid UI layout, and implementing the MVVM design pattern.
Question: How would you approach implementing this project, considering the challange outcomes mentioned?
Expected Response:
Math Operations:
Ensure capturing user input effectively.
Implement algorithms to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handle cases of invalid input gracefully, such as division by zero or unexpected characters.
Grid UI:
Lay out UI elements (buttons representing digits, operators, etc.) in a grid format similar to the iOS calculator app.
Ensure responsiveness across various device sizes and orientations.
MVVM Design Pattern:
Separate concerns by implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.
Model: Represent the data and perform calculations.
View: Display UI elements and handle user interactions.
ViewModel: Act as an intermediary between the Model and View, managing the state and logic of the application.
Follow-up Questions:
Can you elaborate on how you would handle edge cases such as division by zero or user input errors?
How would you test the functionality of the calculator app to ensure it performs calculations accurately?
Could you discuss any additional features or enhancements you might consider adding to the app beyond the basic requirements?
